 - example should be cc, c99 in Makefile
 - example should do better error checking of syscalls

 - test suite should be enriched:
   - rand (random testing with /dev/urandom)
   - perf (somehow measure the performance?)
   - current test should be called unit

 - no more ints, uint8_t return values
 - pfix boolean?
 - proper comparisons 

 - restrict where applicable
 - explicit tests in conditions

 - custom memory allocator possible
 - basic malloc allocator available

 - m_trie_view - way to select a sub-trie, maybe run queries there?
   - link to previous one
   - prefix key as well

 - m_trie_walk
   - execute a function for each key/value
   - ability to select a starting point
   - using DFS
   - DFS to a separate file?

 - m_trie_min/_max
   - retrieve a minimal/maximal key and its value
   - ability to select a starting point
   - always just follow first available pointer
   - is this tricky due to TO_FREE? it is very tricky, might need full DFS
   - might need DFS choice of leftmost | rightmost

 - don't allocate the stack for every call to dfs
   - allocate more to accommodate for a new key if it increases in size
   - trim function should trim this buffer too

 - ability to give a predicate to remove
   - maybe called filter?

 - are remove, purge, and filter the same call?
 
 - sonarqube test
